        "officialMessage": "📢 UPDATE: CAMPUS PARTNER PROGRAM IN INDIA ** Hey @everyone, I wanted to share an important update specifically for our Campus Partners in India. Starting next week, we'll be **PAUSING the Campus Partner Program in India **. This was not my decision, but I want to personally thank each and every one of you for the **creativity, consistency, and hard work** you've shown up to this point. You've helped Perplexity and Comet reach** thousands of students across India** - through campus events, classroom demos, and social media outreach. Your efforts have truly made a difference. 💙 **WHAT THIS MEANS** - Campus Partner links in India will be** paused and stop working by Monday.** - Any **leads submitted before Monday will still be counted, **reviewed, and paid out. - Pending **bounties and payouts will still be processed in full **under the normal 30-business-day review window. - **After Monday, no new leads or referrals will be tracked **or paid since links will be inactive for now. - You'll still have temporary access to your Dub dashboard to view your data — feel free to screenshot or export anything you'd like to save. **WHAT'S NOT CHANGING** - Partners in the U.S., Canada, Europe and other select regions will continue as usual. This change is part of a company-wide restructuring to mitigate the **large amounts of fraud detected in this region. **I know it's disappointing, but your impact has been absolutely incredible, and you've played a huge role in helping Perplexity grow its global student community. I know this isn't easy news to share or receive, but I'm really grateful for everything you've done to help build this community. You've been a huge part of Perplexity's growth, and I can't thank you enough. **We'll share more details about future plans for the program in India as they come.** — Ashna 💙",
