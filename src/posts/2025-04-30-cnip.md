### Course Objectives

- Understand how two computers communicate over the Internet.
- Learn basic functionalities of computer networks.
- Gain knowledge of network programming.
- Explore the evolution and future design needs of computer networks.

---

### Network Architecture

- **Definition:** The conceptual design that defines the structure and operation of a network, visualizing how two remote computers communicate.
- **Requirement:** Conversion of digital data to analog signals and vice versa for communication.
- **End-to-End Traffic Control:** Ensures reliable data transfer across the entire network, not just individual links.

---

### Network Protocol Stack

- **Layered Approach:** Communication tasks are divided into layers, each responsible for specific functions.
- **Key Layers (with examples):**
  - **Application:** HTTP, FTP, SMTP
  - **Transport:** TCP, UDP, RTP
  - **Network:** IPv4, IPv6, MPLS
  - **Data Link:** Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, UMTS, LTE
  - **Physical:** Transmission of raw bits over a medium

---

### Protocols

- **Definition:** A controlled sequence of messages exchanged between systems to accomplish a task.
- **Components:** Specifies message format, sequence, and rules for communication.
- **Examples:** HTTP (web), FTP (file transfer), SMTP (email), TCP (reliable transport), UDP (unreliable transport).

---

### OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

| OSI Layer    | Function                                 |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| Application  | Network applications (file transfer, terminal emulation) |
| Presentation | Data formatting, encryption              |
| Session      | Session establishment/maintenance        |
| Transport    | End-to-end reliable/unreliable delivery  |
| Network      | Packet routing and delivery               |
| Data Link    | Framing, error checking, physical addressing |
| Physical     | Transmission of binary data over the medium |

- **Comparison with TCP/IP:**
  - TCP/IP combines Application, Presentation, and Session into one layer.
  - Both have Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical layers.

---

### TCP/IP Protocol Stack

- **Application Layer:** User processes (e.g., Telnet, FTP, SMTP, HTTP). Uses port numbers and sockets for communication.
- **Transport Layer:** End-to-end data transfer. Main protocols:
  - **TCP:** Connection-oriented, reliable, congestion and flow control.
  - **UDP:** Connectionless, unreliable, faster, used where some data loss is tolerable.
- **Network (Internetwork) Layer:** Provides a virtual network, main protocol is IP (connectionless, no error recovery). Handles routing.
- **Network Interface (Link) Layer:** Interface to physical network hardware (e.g., Ethernet, ATM). May or may not provide reliable delivery.

---

### Encapsulation

- **Concept:** Each layer adds its own header (and sometimes trailer) to the data from the layer above.
- **Order:** Application Data → Transport Header → Network Header → Data Link Header → Physical Transmission

### Network Devices and Their Functions

| Device   | Layer(s) | Function                                  |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| NIC      | 2        | Provides host access to media using MAC addresses |
| Repeater | 1        | Amplifies/retimes signals to extend network distance |
| Hub      | 1        | Multi-port repeater; broadcasts to all ports |
| Bridge   | 2        | Filters traffic based on MAC addresses    |
| Switch   | 2        | Multi-port bridge; dedicated bandwidth per port |
| Router   | 3        | Filters/forwards traffic based on IP addresses |

- **Broadcast Domain:** All devices that receive all network broadcasts on a segment.
- **Collision Domain:** Network area where data packets can collide (hubs = 1 domain, switches = 1 per port).

---

### LAN and WAN

- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Covers small geographic area (e.g., office). Devices: NICs, repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches, routers.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Covers large areas, connects multiple sites, often uses leased lines.

---

### Hierarchical Design Model

- **Access Layer:** End-user connectivity.
- **Distribution Layer:** Policy-based routing, access control.
- **Core Layer:** Fast packet switching across the internetwork.

---

### Switching Technologies

- **Circuit Switching:**
  - Dedicated path between two stations.
  - Phases: Establish, Transfer, Disconnect.
  - Channel reserved for duration, inefficient for data, best for voice.
  - Approaches: Space-Division, Time-Division, TDM Bus.

- **Packet Switching:**
  - Data split into packets, each routed independently.
  - Two types:
    - **Datagram:** Each packet independent, may take different routes, may arrive out of order.
    - **Virtual Circuit:** Preplanned route, all packets follow same path, connection-oriented.
  - Advantages: Efficient line use, data rate conversion, can handle busy networks, priorities possible.

**Comparison Table: Circuit vs. Packet Switching**

| Feature     | Circuit Switching                  | Packet Switching                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Bandwidth   | Guaranteed                       | Dynamically allocated            |
| Efficiency  | Low (wasted if idle)             | High (shared among users)        |
| Delay       | Low, once established            | May have delays/congestion       |
| Suitability | Voice                           | Data                            |
| Cost        | Independent of data transmitted | Based on usage                  |

---

### Internet Architecture

- Defined by IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force).
- Hourglass Model: IP at the narrow waist, many protocols above and below.
- Flexibility: Applications can bypass some layers if needed.

---

### Network Application Programming Interface (API)

- **Socket API:** Standard interface for applications to communicate over the network.
- **Server-Client Model:** Applications exchange messages using sockets.

---

### Application Layer Protocols (Examples and Functions)

- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names to IP addresses. Examples of TLDs: .com, .in, .edu, .gov, .org, .net.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol):** Reliable, uses TCP, transfers files.
- **TFTP (Trivial FTP):** Simpler, uses UDP, often for device configuration.
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Used for web communication.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Used for email transfer between servers.
