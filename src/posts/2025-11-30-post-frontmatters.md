# Post Front-matters — Fields, Usage & Best Practices

This document explains the YAML front-matter keys used across the Materio site, gives common templates you can copy, and highlights pitfalls (for example: unquoted strings containing `:` break YAML). Use this as a quick authoring reference when creating or editing `_posts` entries.

## Why front-matter matters

Front-matter is how Jekyll (and many static-site setups) receives metadata for a page or post. It controls where a post appears, which layout to use, SEO hints (excerpt/image), visibility, and more. Invalid YAML here will break the build (see earlier YAML parsing error example).

## Common fields you will see in this repo

- `title` (string) — The post title shown in lists and the page `<title>`.
- `layout` (string) — Which layout template to use (e.g., `post`, `page`, `documentation`).
- `date` (string / datetime) — Publication date/time. Format used in this repo: `'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS'` (wrap in quotes to be safe).
- `category` (string) — A single category. Many posts use `Documentation` or other categories.
- `tags` (array) — A list of tags used for filtering/search (optional): `tags: [yaml, guides]`.
- `excerpt` (string) — Short summary used in lists and meta; if it contains `:` or other special characters, wrap it in quotes.
- `image` (string) — Path to a cover image (relative to site root).
- `summarize` (boolean) — Used in our templates to control whether the post is summarized on index pages.
 - `summarize` (boolean) — Used in our templates to control whether the post is summarized on index pages.
- `no-ads` (boolean) — When `true` the `post` layout will emit `data-no-ads="true"` and `assets/scripts/post.js` will skip injecting in-article ads for that post. Useful for sponsor posts, documentation, or internal notes where ads are inappropriate.
- `permalink` (string) — When present, overrides the generated URL.
- `hidden` (boolean) — When `true`, hides the post from lists/indexes (still published).
- `author` (string/object) — Who wrote the post (optional; check `_data/authors.yml` for site authorship conventions).
- `draft` (boolean) — If true, Jekyll may skip publishing depending on build flags (commonly used locally).

Other keys you might encounter depending on needs:
- `redirect_from` (array|string) — Build-time redirects.
- `canonical` (string) — Canonical URL for SEO.
- `robots` (string) — `noindex` / `nofollow` hints if needed.

## YAML safety tips and common pitfalls

- Always quote strings that contain `:` or begin with characters that YAML treats specially. Example:

  - Bad (unquoted excerpt containing colon):

    ```yaml
    excerpt: How the Materio promotions system works: JSON schema, ...
    ```

    This will produce a YAML parse error.

  - Good:

    ```yaml
    excerpt: "How the Materio promotions system works: JSON schema, ..."
    ```


    ## Keys Used By Templates & Client-side Scripts

    The templates (especially `_layouts/post.html`) and the client-side scripts (`assets/scripts/post.js` and `assets/scripts/post-base.js`) rely on a small set of front-matter keys and on a couple of in-content tag syntaxes. Below is a canonical reference you can copy into posts and rely on to get the expected runtime behavior.

    - `visibility` (string) — If set to `'private'` the `post` layout emits `data-visibility="private"` on the main post container (`<main class="post-container">`). Client scripts and some templates use this to hide/show private posts.

    - `category` (string) — A single category value. The `post` layout sets `data-category="{{ page.category }}"` on the main post container. Client scripts read that attribute to decide ad-injection and for client-side filtering on index pages.

    - `categories` (array) — A list of categories; used by templates for display (joined and shown in the date/category pill). Use `categories: [one, two]` when needed.

    - `previous_post` / `next_post` (string) — Optional URLs used by the template to render previous/next navigation buttons.

    - `title`, `date`, `excerpt`, `permalink`, `hidden`, `author` — Standard metadata used by templates (author resolves to entries in `_data/authors.yml`). `excerpt` should be quoted if it contains `:`.

    - `image` (string) — Cover media; the template checks whether `page.image` contains video extensions (`.mp4`, `.webm`, `.mov`) and will render a video cover when appropriate. Otherwise an `<img>` is emitted.

    - `summarize` (boolean) — When `true` the template renders the AI Summary UI block (`#ai-summary-section`). Client-side summary actions (in `post.js`) will activate within that block.

    - `toc` (boolean) — The layout checks `page.toc != false`; by default the TOC is shown. Set `toc: false` to suppress the generated in-page TOC.

  ### Author & Share Row Flags

  The `post` layout supports a small set of front-matter boolean flags authors can use to hide the author/share UI that normally appears under a post's title. These are useful for short notes, automated posts, or when you want to suppress share/print/listen affordances on a per-post basis.

  - `hide_author_share_row` (boolean) — When `true` the entire author/share row is not rendered.
  - `hide_author` (boolean) — When `true` the author column is suppressed but other controls (listen/share/print) remain if present.
  - `hide_listen` (boolean) — When `true` the "listen" audio control is not rendered.
  - `hide_share` (boolean) — When `true` the share button/menu is not rendered.
  - `hide_print` (boolean) — When `true` the print action/icon is not rendered.

  Defaults: all flags default to `false` (behaviour unchanged). Use `true` in the post front-matter to hide the corresponding UI.

  Example — hide the whole author/share row:

  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Minimal Announcement
  layout: post
  date: '2025-11-30 15:00:00'
  category: Announcement
  excerpt: "Short announcement."
  hide_author_share_row: true
  ---
  ```

  Example — hide only the share and print controls:

  ```yaml
  ---
  title: Internal Note
  layout: post
  date: '2025-11-30 15:00:00'
  category: Documentation
  excerpt: "Internal guidance."
  hide_share: true
  hide_print: true
  ---
  ```

  Client-side keys and behaviors (authors should be aware):

    - data-attributes emitted by templates:
      - `data-category` — mapped from `page.category`; read by `injectInArticleAds()` and by the home/index filtering scripts.
      - `data-visibility` — mapped when `page.visibility == 'private'`; used by several client-side filters and by home page listing code.

    - In-content tags parsed by `assets/scripts/post.js`:

      - **Attachment tag** — Embeds a downloadable file with preview:
        `[attachment:/path/to/file.pdf:Display Name]`

      - **Video tag** — Embeds a video player:
        `[video: /path/to/video.mp4]`
        
        
        Or as a cover video:
        `[video: /path/to/video.mp4:cover]`

    - Code blocks and language hints:
      - `assets/scripts/post-base.js` detects language labels using common patterns (Rouge `language-...` classes, highlight.js classes, `pre` classes) and will also read `data-language` on the `code` or `pre` elements. Authors can set the language explicitly by using fenced code blocks (```js) which generate `language-...` classes, or by adding `data-language="python"` to the `pre`/`code` when needed.

    - Ads & user-exemptions:
      - `post.js` reads the `materio_user` entry in `localStorage` (if present) and parses it to skip ad injection for Plus/Super users (`user.isPlusUser` or `user.hasAdminPrivileges`). This is not front-matter but affects runtime behavior.
      - `injectInArticleAds()` also checks the post category and has a built-in excluded list: `['Announcement', "What's New", 'Legal']`. If the post category is missing or matches one of those, ads are not injected.

    - Print / QR generation:
      - The print header and QR are created only on pages with a `.post-container` (i.e., posts using the `post` layout). No additional front-matter is required for print, but the presence of `page.visibility`/`page.category` affects whether the header is inserted (the script checks for the post container before proceeding).

- Prefer single-quoted or double-quoted timestamps in front-matter if you include a time portion: `date: '2025-11-30 15:00:00'`.
- Lists should be YAML sequences: `tags: [education, algorithms]` or:

  ```yaml
  tags:
    - education
    - algorithms
  ```

- Indentation matters — use 2 spaces consistently for nested objects.
- If you see `mapping values are not allowed` or `found character that cannot start any token`, open the front-matter and look for unescaped `:` or stray characters.

## Common templates (copy-paste)

Minimal post (public listing):

```yaml
---
title: My Post Title
layout: post
date: '2025-11-30 15:00:00'
category: Documentation
excerpt: "Short description — quote if you include ':' or special chars."
image: /assets/img/covers/example.webp
tags: [howto, docs]
permalink: /posts/my-post
---
```

Hidden / internal doc (published but not in lists):

```yaml
---
title: Internal Notes
layout: post
date: '2025-11-30 15:00:00'
category: Documentation
excerpt: "Internal guide for maintainers."
hidden: true
---
```

Redirecting old URL(s) to new permalink:

```yaml
---
title: Renamed Post
layout: post
date: '2024-05-20 12:00:00'
permalink: /docs/renamed
redirect_from:
  - /old/path/renamed-post
  - /old/alias
---
```

Advanced metadata (author, canonical, robots):

```yaml
---
title: Deep Dive: Feature X
layout: post
date: '2025-10-01 09:30:00'
category: Guides
tags: [feature-x, developer]
author: jinansh
canonical: https://materioa.netlify.app/docs/feature-x
robots: noindex
---
```

## Quick validation & testing steps

- Before committing: run a YAML linter on modified posts if you have one (many editors have plugins).
- Build locally (Jekyll) to surface YAML/front-matter errors quickly:

```powershell
# If you use Bundler and Jekyll
# bundle exec jekyll build
# or serve locally
# bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```

- Check the terminal output — a YAML parsing error will point to the file and line number.
- On CI, ensure build flags treat drafts/hidden consistently. If your local build shows a parse error, fix the quoting/indentation and rebuild.

## Best practices & style

- Keep front-matter minimal for short posts; move long metadata into the post body or data files (`_data`).
- Use `hidden: true` for ephemeral or maintenance posts that must be published but not shown in lists.
- Prefer `permalink` for canonical location when migrating old content.
- Use `tags` for filtering and `category` for broad grouping.
- Use `author` values that correspond to `_data/authors.yml` entries so author pages render correctly.

## Troubleshooting checklist (when a post fails to build)

1. Open the post and inspect the first block (`---` to `---`) for unquoted strings with `:`.
2. Validate indentation and list syntax (`- item` under `tags:`).
3. Ensure the file starts with `---` and ends the front-matter with `---` before the content.
4. Run a local build to get a line/column pointer to the error.
5. If you still can't find it, temporarily remove parts of the front-matter (binary search) until the build error disappears, then re-add carefully.

{: .info}

> "This is a styled quote."
{: .quote}
```
