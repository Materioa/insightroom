# Getting Started with SvelteKit

SvelteKit is a framework for building web applications with Svelte.

## Why SvelteKit?

1. **Server-side rendering** - Better SEO and initial load
2. **File-based routing** - Easy to understand structure
3. **Great developer experience** - Fast hot module replacement

## Quick Start

Create a new project:

```bash
npm create svelte@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

That's it! Your app is now running.
